        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>I reviewed Sumran Nassir's Fast Fuels site for our ITIS 3135 client assignment.</p>

        <p>
          Site link:
          <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mnasir2/indexff.html"
             target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            Fast Fuels home page
          </a>
        </p>

        <figure class="review-image">
          <img
            src="images/sumran-nassir-fast-fuels.png"
            alt="Homepage screenshot of Fast Fuels with navigation, welcome text, fuel photos, and address."
            width="900">
          <figcaption>Homepage screenshot from Sumran Nassir's Fast Fuels site.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>I read the home page text, looked at the images, and checked links in the navigation bar.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>What works well</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The Fast Fuels name appears at the top and matches the client focus.</li>
          <li>The navigation labels for Home, About, Services, Gallery, and Contact are clear.</li>
          <li>The welcome heading explains that Fast Fuels is a gas station in Thomasville, NC.</li>
          <li>The sentence about fuel, service, and the store gives a fast overview of what visitors receive.</li>
          <li>The three photos for pumps, station exterior, and store support the description.</li>
          <li>The address at the bottom helps visitors see where the station sits in town.</li>
          <li>Validator links in the footer support course checks for HTML and CSS.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>What needs attention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The word “conveinent” in the welcome text has a spelling error. I suggest changing that word to “convenient”.</li>
          <li>The “Current Time” label shows a close symbol. I suggest updating this feature so a clear time display appears for visitors.</li>
          <li>The home page would benefit from one short list that names fuel grades or key services.</li>
          <li>The gallery area would gain clarity from short captions that explain each photo.</li>
          <li>A contact prompt with a short line such as “Visit us today” or “Stop by for fuel and snacks” would support user action.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>Match with project requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The site follows a clear structure with header, navigation, main content, and footer area.</li>
          <li>The Fast Fuels name appears near the top of the page in a consistent way.</li>
          <li>Headings move in a logical order from “Welcome to Fast Fuels” down to smaller sections.</li>
          <li>Navigation links lead to the expected pages and match the labels shown.</li>
          <li>Content focuses on a real client project for a local gas station and store.</li>
          <li>Text speaks to drivers and customers who need fuel and everyday items.</li>
          <li>Images support the station story and give visitors a sense of the place.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>Stop, Start, Continue</h3>

        <h4>Stop</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Leaving the “Current Time” area without a clear time display.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Start</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixing the spelling in the welcome paragraph so the message reads smoothly.</li>
          <li>Adding one short list of services or fuel options on the home page.</li>
          <li>Writing brief captions under each gallery photo to explain what visitors see.</li>
          <li>Adding a short action line near the address to invite visitors to stop by.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Continue</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Using a direct welcome heading that names the client site.</li>
          <li>Keeping navigation simple and easy to follow for each page.</li>
          <li>Including the address and validator links in the footer area.</li>
        </ul>
