        <h4>Overview</h4>

        <p>I reviewed Josiah Flowers' project site for our ITIS 3135 client assignment.</p>

        <p>
          Site link:
          <a href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/jflowe27/itis3135/project/index.html"

            Project home page for Josiah Flowers

        <p>I moved through the home page and the main links and I took notes on structure, writing, and layout.</p>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>What works well</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>I like that your site title with your name is clear and easy to read.</li>
          <li>Your navigation bar uses simple labels that match the content on each page.</li>
          <li>Your welcome text on the home page explains the purpose of the site in a direct way.</li>
          <li>Short paragraphs make your content easy to read.</li>
          <li>Buttons and links guide your visitor toward next steps, such as reading more details.</li>
          <li>Spacing between sections keeps the page from feeling crowded.</li>
          <li>Headings break the content into clear groups for visitors and for screen readers.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>What needs attention</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The home page needs at least one strong visual element, such as a main image related to the project.</li>
          <li>Some sections feel short. One or two extra sentences in key sections would help visitors understand the client and goals.</li>
          <li>Links in the body text would benefit from short phrases that describe what a visitor sees after a click.</li>
          <li>A short note about the client or organization on the home page would help users connect with the purpose of the site.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>Match with project requirements</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The site follows a clear structure with header, navigation, main content, and footer area.</li>
          <li>The project name appears near the top of the page in a consistent way.</li>
          <li>Headings move in a logical order from page title to section titles.</li>
          <li>Navigation links work and lead to the expected pages.</li>
          <li>Content focuses on a real client project for the course.</li>
          <li>Text speaks to potential users and explains what they gain from the site.</li>
          <li>There is space for images or future visuals without crowding the text.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="review-section">
        <h3>Stop, Start, Continue</h3>

        <h4>Stop</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Leaving large areas of the home page without images or visual anchors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Start</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Adding a main hero image or banner that reflects the project focus.</li>
          <li>Writing one extra sentence in each main section to give visitors stronger context.</li>
          <li>Adding a short client summary on the home page so visitors know who you support.</li>
          <li>Including a simple footer line with course info or a contact link.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Continue</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>Using simple headings and short paragraphs.</li>
          <li>Keeping navigation clear and consistent across pages.</li>
          <li>Aligning content to a central column so visitors follow the same reading path on every page.</li>
        </ul>
